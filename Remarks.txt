Attack Model:
An adversary with read/write access to program's data regions looking to leverage memory corruption vulnerabilities
to read/write data or inject code or employ code re-use for malicious intent.

Our Systems:
Operating System and Application Software written in C
DSPs, MCUs, etc

Solution:
Employ Memory Safety (Optimzed performance for embedded systems)
Code-Pointer Integrity/CFI and Data Confidentiality (to prevent data exfiltration and control-flow hijacking)

Maintain architectural constraints - Throughput, Integrability & Certifiability
